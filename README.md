## Promises/A+
Spec of common, standardised behaviour 
https://promisesaplus.com/

Notes:

Events are great for things that can happen 
multiple times on the same object â€” keyup, touchstart etc.
async success/failure
A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or fail twice, 
neither can it switch from success to failure or vice versa
If a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure 
callback, the correct callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier


A promise can be:

*fulfilled*
    The action relating to the promise succeeded
*rejected*
    The action relating to the promise failed
*pending*
    Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet
*settled*
    Has fulfilled or rejected

*thenable*: object that is promise-like, with a `then` method

*Promises/A+*: common, standardised behaviour (spec)

*must not change* means immutable identity (i.e. ===), but does not imply deep immutability.
